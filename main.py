I used to be a farmer, and I made a fine living
I had a little stretch of land along the CP line
But times were hard and though I tried, the money wasn't there
And the bankers came and took my land and told me "fair is fair".

I looked for every kind of job, and the answer was always no
"Hire you right now?" they'd always laugh, "We just let twenty go!"
The government, they promised me a measly little sum
But I've got too much pride to end up on the streets.

Then I thought, who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone?
I'm gonna be a PIRATE on the river of Saskatchewan!
